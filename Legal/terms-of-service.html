<p>Acceptable Use Policy</p>

<p>Fair Usage Policy for Synthetix Minecraft and Game Hosting Plans</p>
<p>By default, the Company does not count MySQL database usage towards Your storage allocation. However, certain Minecraft plugins such as Dynmap result in excessively large database files. If the combined storage of your databases exceed 10GB, the Company reserves the right to take one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p>The Company may reduce your storage allocation by the amount of space your MySQL databases are using.</p>
<p>The Company may move your database and/or Minecraft server to another node in the same region.</p>
<p>The Company may ask that you upgrade to a plan with a higher storage capacity.</p>
<p>The Company may ask that you discontinue using the plugin(s) that result in the increased storage.</p>
<p>The Company may cancel or suspend your service if the excess storage usage is not rectified through any of the above methods.</p>
<p>Bandwidth</p>
<p>By default, the Company does not impose limitations on bandwidth for our Minecraft and Game Hosting plans. However, due to the high cost of bandwidth, the Company reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or remove non-Minecraft servers that use greater than 1TB of inbound bandwidth per month OR non-Minecraft servers that are in the top 5% of bandwidth usage during a given period. Common services that may result in action taken due to high bandwidth usage include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Discord Music Streaming Bots</p>
<p>VPN servers</p>
<p>Any form of content delivery services</p>
<p>Mojang EULA</p>

<p>If your Service is found to be in violation of Mojang&#39;s EULA, the Service may be suspended until the violating content is removed from the Service.</p>
<p>Terms Specific to Bare Metal Dedicated Servers</p>
<p>Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Bare Metal Dedicated Servers</p>
<p>The Company offers a 99% monthly Uptime guarantee for all Bare Metal Dedicated Servers. This uptime guarantee is for power and networking services only, and does not include scheduled and communicated maintenance periods. It also does not include network disruption due to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Downtime is calculated beginning with notification of service impairment and ending when resolved by the Company. Any downtime exceeding 0.01% in a given billing cycle will be compensated as follows:</p>
<p>Downtime exceeding 5 minutes but less than or equal to 1 hour will be eligible for a 5% credit.</p>
<p>Downtime exceeding 1 hour but less than or equal to 2 hours will be eligible for a 10% credit.</p>
<p>Downtime exceeding 2 hours but less than or equal to 4 hours will be eligible for a 15% credit.</p>
<p>Downtime exceeding 4 hours but less than or equal to 6 hours will be eligible for a 20% credit.</p>
<p>Downtime exceeding 6 hours will be eligible for a credit equal to twenty times the percentage of monthly service lost due to downtime up to a maximum of 100%.</p>
<p>SLA credits must be requested by You within 72 hours following the end of the downtime incident. Credits are provided towards future Company invoices or payments and are not redeemable or refundable for any currency.</p>
<p>Bandwidth Limits and Speeds</p>
<p>Each product has a specified bandwidth limit that is explicitly stated in the product description and during checkout. Bandwidth calculations include both inbound and outbound traffic as calculated by the raw data provided by the switch that each server is physically connected to. If bandwidth limits are reached during the month, the service will be subject to suspension until a bandwidth add-on is purchased. Bandwidth limits including add-ons only apply to a single month of service and unused bandwidth does not roll over to future months.</p>
<p>Each product also has a specified port speed (such as &quot;1G&quot; indicating a 1Gbps physical connection.) This specified port speed relates to the physical port and accordingly the Company makes no guarantee of throughput speeds.</p>
<p>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</p>
<p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.  These exclusions are for factors generally outside Company&#39;s reasonable controls, a.k.a., force majeure</p>
<p>Governing Law</p>

<p>Severability and Waiver</p>
<p>Severability</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Waiver</p>
<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Terms shall not effect a party&#39;s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
<p>Translation Interpretation</p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service. You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
<p>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.
